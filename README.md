This package I made for my final year project namely INFRAVEIN for blood vessels detection under Python Image Processing Techniques. It contains only one class called vein detect. All you have to do is to create three folders namely "data", "raw_vessels" and "vessels_images". In the data folder, you have to place the image, whose veins you want to detect. The python script will be provided soon.
